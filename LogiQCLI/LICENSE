    arising from such display shall inure exclusively to the Owner.

4.  PATENT LICENCE AND PATENT RETALIATION
    4.1  Grant.  The Owner hereby grants You a non-exclusive, worldwide,
         royalty-free licence under Owner’s Necessary Claims to make, use,

    4.2  Retaliation.  This License (including the patent licence of §4.1)
         shall automatically and irrevocably terminate, without notice, if
         You or any party acting on Your behalf asserts or voluntarily
         assists any third party in asserting a patent infringement claim
         alleging that the Software or any Derivative Work infringes a
         patent.

        Derivative Work;

    (b) Host, provide, or otherwise make the functionality of the Software
        available to any third party, whether as a service, via remote

        regulation, including export-control laws and data-protection laws.

6.  COMMERCIAL DISTRIBUTION LICENCES
    Any Commercial Use or Distribution of the Software or a Derivative Work
    requires a CDL.  No right to Commercial Use or Distribution is granted
    by default.  The Owner reserves the right to grant or withhold a CDL in
    its sole discretion.

7.  CONTRIBUTIONS
    7.1  Licence/Assignment.  To the maximum extent permitted by applicable
         law, and as a condition of submitting a Contribution, You hereby
         (a) irrevocably assign to the Owner all right, title, and interest
         in and to the Contribution, or, if such assignment is invalid,
         grant the Owner an exclusive, perpetual, worldwide, royalty-free
         licence (with right of sublicense) to use, reproduce, modify,
         distribute, perform, display, and create derivative works of the
         Contribution for any purpose; and (b) waive and agree never to
         assert any moral or similar rights in the Contribution against the
         Owner or its licensees.

    7.2  No Obligation to Accept.  The Owner has sole discretion whether to
         use, merge, modify, relicence, or discard any Contribution.

8.  ATTRIBUTION & NOTICE
    8.1  All copies of the Software and all Derivative Works, in whole or in
         part, must conspicuously retain (a) this License, (b) the copyright
         notice above, and (c) all other proprietary legends present in the
         Software.

    8.2  You must not misrepresent the origin of the Software, rename the
         Software, or remove or alter any reference to the name “LogiQCLI”
         or the Owner.

9.  COMPLIANCE VERIFICATION (AUDIT)
    Upon fourteen (14) days’ written notice, and no more than once in any
    twelve-month period unless material non-compliance is found, the Owner
    or its independent auditor may audit Your records and systems solely to
    verify compliance with this License.  The audit shall occur during
    normal business hours and be subject to reasonable confidentiality
    obligations.  If an audit reveals material non-compliance (defined as
    any violation affecting more than five per cent of installations or
    usage), You shall promptly (a) obtain the requisite CDL(s) retroactive
    to the date the non-compliance began, (b) pay the reasonable costs of
    the audit, and (c) implement corrective measures.

10. TELEMETRY, PRIVACY & DATA PROTECTION
    10.1 Collection.  The Software may automatically collect and transmit
         Telemetry Data—such as unique installation IDs, operating-system
         details, feature-usage frequency, performance metrics, and error
         logs—to the Owner.

    10.2 Purpose.  Telemetry Data is processed for the legitimate interests
         of (a) improving the Software, (b) providing support, and (c)
         verifying compliance with this License.  Telemetry Data is not sold
         to third parties.

    10.3 Personal Data.  Where Telemetry Data constitutes personal data
         under the UK GDPR, EU GDPR, CCPA, or similar laws, the Owner shall
         process such data in accordance with those laws under the lawful
         basis of legitimate interests.  You are responsible for ensuring
         that Your use of the Software, including any processing of personal
         data, complies with all applicable laws.

    10.4 Opt-Out.  If the Software provides an in-product setting to disable
         telemetry, You may exercise that option.  If no such setting is
         provided, Your only means of opting out is to cease using the
         Software.

    10.5 Security & Retention.  The Owner shall implement commercially
         reasonable technical and organisational measures to protect
         Telemetry Data and shall retain Telemetry Data only as long as
         necessary for the purposes stated above or as required by law.

11. RESERVATION OF RIGHTS
    All rights not expressly granted to You are reserved by the Owner.  No
    licence or right is created by implication, estoppel, or otherwise.

12. TERM, TERMINATION & CURE
    12.1  Term.  This License commences on the date You first obtain the
          Software and continues until terminated.

    12.2  Termination for Breach.  The Owner may terminate this License upon
          written notice if You materially breach any provision and fail to
          cure such breach within fourteen (14) days of notice.  No cure
          period applies to breaches that are incapable of cure, to
          violations of §4.2 (patent retaliation), or to intentional
          infringement of the Owner’s intellectual-property rights, all of
          which result in immediate termination without notice.

    12.3  Post-Termination Obligations.  Upon termination, You must
          immediately cease all use of the Software and Derivative Works,
          destroy all copies in Your possession or control, and certify such
          destruction to the Owner in writing within fifteen (15) days.

    12.4  Survival.  §§3–6, 7.1–7.2, 8–15, and any other provision that by
          its nature should survive, shall survive termination.

13. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY
    THE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED “AS IS” AND “AS AVAILABLE” WITHOUT WARRANTY OF
    ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION,
    MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, TITLE, ACCURACY, AND
    NON-INFRINGEMENT.  YOUR USE OF THE SOFTWARE IS AT YOUR SOLE RISK.

14. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY
    TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, IN NO EVENT SHALL
    THE OWNER OR ITS CONTRIBUTORS BE LIABLE FOR ANY INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL,
    SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, PUNITIVE, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OR FOR ANY LOSS
    OF PROFITS, REVENUE, DATA, OR GOODWILL, HOWEVER CAUSED AND ON ANY THEORY
    OF LIABILITY, WHETHER IN CONTRACT, STRICT LIABILITY, OR TORT (INCLUDING
    NEGLIGENCE), EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.  EXCEPT
    FOR LIABILITY THAT CANNOT LEGALLY BE LIMITED (E.G., FOR DEATH OR
    PERSONAL INJURY CAUSED BY NEGLIGENCE, OR FOR FRAUD), THE OWNER’S
    AGGREGATE LIABILITY UNDER THIS LICENSE SHALL NOT EXCEED THE GREATER OF
    (A) FIFTY POUNDS STERLING (£50) OR (B) THE AMOUNT, IF ANY, ACTUALLY PAID
    BY YOU TO THE OWNER FOR A CDL WITHIN THE TWELVE MONTHS PRECEDING THE
    CLAIM.

15. GOVERNING LAW & DISPUTE RESOLUTION
    15.1  Governing Law.  This License shall be governed by and construed in
          accordance with the laws of England and Wales, without regard to
          conflict-of-laws principles.

    15.2  Jurisdiction.  The courts located in England shall have exclusive
          jurisdiction over any dispute arising out of or relating to this
          License, except that if You are a consumer resident in a
          jurisdiction that mandates local venue, this §15.2 does not
          deprive You of any right to bring or defend claims in that local
          venue.

    15.3  Jury-Trial Waiver.  Each party irrevocably waives, to the maximum
          extent permitted by law, any right to trial by jury in any dispute
          arising out of or related to this License.

16. EQUITABLE RELIEF
    You acknowledge that a breach of this License may cause irreparable harm
    to the Owner for which monetary damages are an inadequate remedy, and
    agree that, in such event, the Owner may seek injunctive or other
    equitable relief in any court of competent jurisdiction, in addition to
    any other remedies available at law or in equity.

17. SEVERABILITY
    If any provision of this License is held unenforceable or invalid by a
    court of competent jurisdiction, the provision shall be revised only to
    the minimum extent necessary to make it enforceable, and the remaining
    provisions shall remain in full force and effect.

18. ENTIRE AGREEMENT
    This License constitutes the complete and exclusive agreement between
    You and the Owner concerning the Software and supersedes all prior or
    contemporaneous oral or written communications, proposals, and
    representations.

19. AMENDMENTS
    The Owner may publish new versions of this License.  A new version will
    not apply to You unless and until (a) You expressly agree to the new
    version, or (b) You install or use an Update that is expressly
    distributed under the new version, in which case Your first use of that
    Update constitutes acceptance of the new version with respect to that
    Update only.
